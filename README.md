# Text_to_Numerical_-
A function for converting textual numbers to numerical numbers
Textual_to_Numerical
The function is to convert textual # to a numerical #.
Actually, I have a technique interview that let me set up a Machine Learning Model to reach this goal. However, I didn't learn it before so I wrote this function.
